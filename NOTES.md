# WESS Standings for current Season

- Will scrape https://iridewess.com/events/ to get race list, and then list details, or results from each race.

- Challenges / additional thoughts
	- How to make this fail proof for future?
	- Would it be a simple URL change for scrape in future?


- Mock Build Up
